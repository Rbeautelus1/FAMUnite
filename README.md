# FAMUnite
## ðŸš€ About the Project
Students at FAMU have issues staying up to date with clubs, organizations, and university partner events on campus. Information is scattered between social media, iStrike, and email, which is hard to keep track of and stay current. FAMUnite will provide a centralized, user-friendly application that allows students to receive the most updated information. The app will enable students to view, register, save, and receive event reminders. Integrating event data from multiple sources, like Instagram and iStrike, provides a single, easy-to-use platform for staying informed about campus activities.
